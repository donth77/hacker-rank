#Dealing Cards

Problem Statement
----------------

Elon and Patrick are trading pokemon cards.

Since Elon and Patrick are pokemon fanatics, they love trading cards, and learning all about new pokemon.

But they do not want to get a card they already have. For this reason, they have agreed to remove any cards they both have.

Your goal is to take in both decks of cards, and then print the cards that Elon will offer, followed by the cards that Patrick will offer. Make no assumptions about how many cards Elon and Patrick may have- they are big fans and could have up to 1000 pokemon cards in a single hand.

Oh, one more thing. When you remove a card from one of their hands, you had best not switch the order of any of the cards. If you do, there is sure to be rampage...

Input Format
-----------

Given n pokemon cards, you will have a file of n lines where each line contains the format:

Elon  
name number  
.
.
name number  
Patrick  
name number  
.  
.  
.  
name number  
where name is the name of the card, and the #number is the pokemons number according to the national dex.

Output Format
-------------

Output which cards Elon will offer, and which cards Patrick will offer- see below examples.
